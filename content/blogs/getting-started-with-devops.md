## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

### Key Principles

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks to save time and reduce errors
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automate testing and deployment processes
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage infrastructure using code
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Track application performance and issues

## Getting Started

### 1. Learn the Basics

Start with understanding:
- Linux command line
- Version control (Git)
- Basic scripting (Bash, Python)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### 2. Practice with Tools

Familiarize yourself with popular DevOps tools:
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipelines
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code

### 3. Build Projects

Create real-world projects to practice:
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy applications to the cloud
- Automate infrastructure provisioning
- Monitor and troubleshoot systems
